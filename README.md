# Conch Race Predictor V3 — Shared Online Database + Server Monte Carlo

This version turns the V2 prototype into a single web application with a shared server database and server-side prediction API.

## Architecture

**Website → Express API → shared race database → Bayesian/recency model → Monte Carlo → probabilities**

- React/Vite frontend
- Express backend
- Persistent JSON race database (`data/races.json`)
- Server-side prediction endpoint (`POST /api/predict`)
- Up to **1,000,000 Monte Carlo simulations** on the server
- Browser fallback capped at 100,000 simulations if the API is unavailable
- Existing historical database manager, lineup editor, live simulator and settings retained

## API

- `GET /api/health` — server/database status
- `GET /api/records` — shared race history
- `POST /api/records` — add a race
- `POST /api/records/bulk` — replace/import the database
- `DELETE /api/records/:id` — delete one race
- `DELETE /api/records` — clear all races
- `POST /api/predict` — calculate a prediction using the shared historical database

## Local development

Terminal 1:

```bash
npm install
npm run server:dev
```

Terminal 2:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The Vite development server proxies `/api` to `http://localhost:8787`.

For a production-style local test:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

Then open `http://localhost:8787`.

## Deploy as one website

The included `Dockerfile` and `render.yaml` are prepared for a persistent single-instance Render deployment. The persistent disk keeps `data/races.json` between deploys/restarts.

1. Put this folder in a GitHub repository.
2. Create a Render Web Service from the repository, or use the included `render.yaml` as a Blueprint.
3. Use `npm ci && npm run build` as the build command and `npm start` as the start command if configuring manually.
4. Keep the persistent disk mounted at the project's `data` directory.
5. Render will provide the HTTPS website address.

The app then has one shared database: race results entered from your PC or phone are available to every user of that deployed instance.

## Important production note

The included JSON database is intentionally simple so the project can run without a separate database account. For a larger multi-user deployment, replace `data/races.json` with PostgreSQL/Supabase. The API boundary is already separated so that migration can be done without redesigning the frontend.

## Prediction model

The model conditions the simulation on historical evidence **before** Monte Carlo runs:

1. Bayesian-smoothed win rate
2. Bayesian-smoothed Top-3 rate
3. Recency of recent finishes
4. Actual head-to-head finishing history
5. Historical performance under the selected emoticon
6. Current win count
7. Current popularity as a weak crowd signal
8. Current six-conch lineup
9. Per-run race variance and morale events

The output includes win probability, Top-2, Top-3, average rank, Exacta, Trifecta and head-to-head probabilities.

These are statistical estimates, not guarantees. Use the historical database and future backtesting to evaluate calibration and accuracy.
